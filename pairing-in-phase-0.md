# Pairing in Phase 0

Pairing is common in software development. Software Engineers pair in order to:

* reduce code errors and/or catch errors early
* share or transfer knowledge
* on-board new developers

Pairing can feel stressful or awkward at first. We ask that you keep an open mind on pairing throughout DBC and challenge yourself to work on your pairing skills while here.

## Pairing in Phase 0

During Phase 0, you are required to pair twice each week on top of any Guided Pairing Sessions. This adds up to a lot of time spent coding with others! You will be doing even more pairing when you get to Dev Bootcamp on site.

The first step in pairing is to decide who will be driver and navigator. Here are the definitions of the roles.

Driver: This is the person with the hands on the keyboard. By default all typing of code should come from the driver. If the navigator wants to type something, asking permission is the best procedure.

Navigator: This is the person who is not typing. This frees you up to look for syntax errors, research quickly, have docs open etc. Your role in the development of the program is the same as the driver, you just do not type unless permission is granted.

The navigator is not an annoying back-seat driver. The role is **not** to say: "Type d.e.f. space my underscore method new line." Instead it should go something like: "Let's make a method. What should we call it?"

If the driver needs help with syntax, by all means help them, but pairing shoud be a conversation, not step-by-step directions.

## Pairing Dynamics

Who has the power in this relationship?

Neither role is more powerful than the other. You are just 2 programmers trying to solve a problem together. The roles are there to make you more efficient, not bog you down. Think of this as a brainstorming session with the driver holding the marker. Both of you are thinking of ideas simultaneously and discussing which ones are good enough to get on the board.

#### Switching Roles
It expected that pairs switch roles.

Discuss with your pair before starting the exercise at what point you would like to switch (time based, exercise based, etc.).

## Successful Pairing

### The components
Successful pairing requires two components:

#### Good Communication
Good communication during pairing is mainly through vocalizing your thoughts and thought process.

If you don't understand, tell your partner.

If you want to try something in IRB, tell your pair.

If you want to go research something, tell your partner.

*Tell your partner everything you are thinking and doing!*

#### Being on the same page
Both people should know the exact line of code and the solution or concept they are discussing.

**Good pairing sessions feel like a conversation**.

## Pairing Remotely

Pairing over the internet has its unique issues. It is easy to misinterpret people's intentions and tone. Technical issues can create added difficulties on understanding one another.

Overcommunication is preferable when working remotely, especially when you are just starting to pair with someone. You can find out how they like to work and communicate as you go, but to start, be overly expressive of your needs.

## Strategies for difficult sessions
If you feel your pair isn't listening to you or taking your perspective into account, you need to speak up! Your pair is learning this new skill, too. Make sure you bring up your concerns with specific, actionable,and kind feedback. [I messaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message) is a great way to do this. "I messages" generally follow this format

I feel... (Insert feeling word)
when... (tell what caused the feeling).
I would like... (tell what you want to happen instead).

For example:

I felt ignored when I brought up my idea about how many arguments that method should accept. I would like to have more of an open discourse with the direction of the code.

Instead of:

You aren't listening to me, stop being difficult. I want to talk about the number of arguments the method should accept.

I-messages are a powerful communication tool that prevents conflicts from escalating.
