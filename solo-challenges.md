# Solo Challenges

There are four challenges in the curriculum that will be labeled "Solo Challenges."

## Purpose
Solo challenges are designed to provide you the opportunity to work on your own and see how confident you are with the learning outcomes.

From the teacher's perspective, solo challenges provide us with an example of your work. We use these to assess how you are doing and give you feedback. We want to see that you are following the process we've outlined (pseudocode, initial code, refactor, reflect) and are demonstrating your familiarity and ability to implement the learning outcomes. We do not expect your code to be perfect; we expect it to show how you work through a problem on your own. We will be evaluating each section, not just your initial or refactored solution.

**Solo Challenges draw on the various learning outcomes you are covering in that particular week, and are in the middle in terms of difficulty. It would be a good idea to go through the other challenges prior to completing the solo challenge.

## Expectations
### Research
We ask you to follow a different protocol when researching for these challenges because they are meant to be an example of your work and current abilities.

1. Please do not consult anyone (including friends, family, cohort-mates, or DBC staff) on any part of the challenge (the one exception is if you need clarification on instructions). This includes office hours. Sorry!
2. Keep your research limited to questions relating to syntax, documentation, or programming concepts. The methodology for solving the challenge should be entirely your own.
3. Abstain from researching or using solutions to the challenge. *See plagiarism section below for details.*

##### Pseudocode:
Your pseudocode should break the problem down into small pieces. Challenge yourself to really break the problem down into code-like English. See these guides: [Pseudocode Standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html) or [Pseudocode Overview](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs482/2003su/handouts/pseudocode.pdf). NOTE: Pseudocode is not required for HTML/CSS solo challenges.

##### Refactoring
Don't spend your time writing a completely new solution. Instead, simplify your existing solution, improve the naming and readability, and remove any unnecessary code or implement the code using new methods. If you find yourself wanting to completely change the interior logic of your solution, make sure you explain why you decided to make that shift.

##### Reflection
Your reflection is important in all challenges, but especially in your Solo Challenges. The reflections will show whether you understand the learning outcomes or not.

When writing reflections, write for your future self or another reader, not to yourself in the moment. You want to focus on describing what made the challenge difficult, and be specific about what you did. Did you have difficulty implementing a method? Did you not understand a concept? Did you spend ages trying to fix a bug only to realize you misspelled something? Your reader doesn't know the process you went through, and they only see what you put in your solution. So be clear about what problems you faced, what research and sources you used, and what you learned. This is your chance to teach your audience and describe your experience.

### Plagiarism
Now for the part we all dread...plagiarism. So what is it exactly? In this context it's submitting work that did not come out of your head. In the past, students feared the solo challenges because they considered them a test that had a "right" answer. But there are no "right" answers at Dev Bootcamp. There are solutions that work, and solutions that need work. We want you to learn, and we know that learning often comes from failure.

What we mean to say is, if you are stuck and can't get a working solution, DO NOT panic and submit a solution that you found online. You will be cheating yourself of the learning opportunity and we will consider you out of integrity. This will result in a conversation and you may be asked to leave the program. If you find yourself in a situation where your code is not doing what you expected or want, explain what's going wrong (i.e. what you expected to happen and what's actually happening) in your reflection. Then take a break and sleep on it. Don't ever continue to struggle for hours in the hopes you will come to it. You'll be amazed how much better you'll feel after taking a break, and doing so will increase your chances of finding errors.

It is your responsibility to be able to explain **every. single. piece** of code and why it's necessary.

There has been some confusion on researching and plagiarism in the past because programming is often a collaborative experience, and even senior developers will look up solutions. That is generally ok, but there are exceptions. Guides and employers want to see what you can do on your own, how you solve problems, and how you think. That is why it is critical to ensure that everything you write in your solo challenge came from your brain. For solo challenges, only use documentation to help you research.

## Code Review and Feedback

You will receive a code review and feedback four times in Phase 0 on your solo challenges for weeks 3, 5, 6, and 7. Each guide has their own style, but many will focus on what you can do to improve. We want you to think of feedback as helpful to your growth, not an indicator of failure. If you were a perfect programmer, why would you be coming to Dev Bootcamp?

You will not be kicked out of the program for having a hard time with one challenge. If you seem to be struggling with the concepts, we will consult your other solo challenges to see how you did with those and come up with a plan.

You will receive feedback for four of your solo challenges. The schedule is below:

    Unit 1:
     - Week 1: No Solo Challenge
     - Week 2: No Reviewed Solo Challenge
     - Week 3: Your Website (Reviewed)

    Unit 2
     - Week 4: No Reviewed Solo Challenge
     - Week 5: Ruby Collection Types and Enumerables (Reviewed)
     - Week 6: Ruby Classes and Objects (Reviewed)

    Unit 3
     - Week 7: JavaScript Game (Reviewed)
     - Week 8: No Solo Challenge
     - Week 9: No Solo Challenge
