# Dev Bootcamp student and guest Anti-Harassment Policy

### Applies to

This policy governs the behavior of students, guides and staff in Phase 0. This includes in blog posts, on any Phase 0 discussion boards (such as Canvas discussions), while you are pairing with other students, leaving feedback and any other interaction/communication with people associated with DBC. In addition to this policy covering the Phase 0 space, it also covers students, alumni, staff and guests in our locations spaces or any gathering related to DBC.  The Bootcamp Education, Inc. Sexual Harassment policy overrides anything in this policy.

**We expect participants to follow these rules at the Dev Bootcamp space (including all online spaces, communities, and interactions) and all related social events.**

## Quick version
Dev Bootcamp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment and experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at Dev Bootcamp, including talks.  Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave without a refund at the discretion of Dev Bootcamp staff. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at [below](#long-version)

## Long version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Dev Bootcamp alumni, employers, and guests are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dev Bootcamp Staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Dev Bootcamp; for students this means expulsion from the program with no refund; for others, this includes expulsion from or banning of the Dev Bootcamp space with no refund if applicable.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of Dev Bootcamp Staff immediately.

Dev Bootcamp Staff will be happy to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of their time in Phase 0 and at Dev Bootcamp.
