During your first week of Phase 0, you will have an intro session with your Teacher. These sessions will be scheduled to last an hour and will all be held between the hours of 9:00am PST and 6:00pm PST.

The purpose of these sessions are:

1. Introduce you to some of your cohort mates
2. Make sure you have access to all our systems
3. Cover a few high level/important points to make sure we are all on the same page
4. Make sure all your questions are answered

These sessions are mandatory to attend. Also please note that you do NOT have to wait to start on your Week 1 challenges until you have your session.
