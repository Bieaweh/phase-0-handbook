Please refrain from reaching out via other channels as this will increase your wait time.

Please note: Our office hours are from 9am-6pm Monday through Friday (depending on your instructor's time zone). We are not available to respond on weekends. We prioritize responding to emails as soon as possible when we are back in the office on Monday.

If you send an email after business hours on Friday or on the weekend, please wait until mid-Monday to follow up if you haven't received a response.
