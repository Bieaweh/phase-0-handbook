# Welcome to DBC!

We are so excited that you have decided to embark on this amazing, life-changing journey with us.  Over the next few months you are not only going to learn how to "Make Beautiful and Meaningful Things" but you are going to learn a lot about yourself and others. You are going to interact with many different staff members at different parts of the program who are going to guide, support, and challenge you.

Before you can start Phase 0, you will need to complete a few administrative tasks as well as some personal preparation. Please go through each of these sections and complete each task. You should be well acquainted with Phase 0 and what is expected of you by doing this. If you do not feel fully acquainted or know exactly  what is expected of you, do not worry, there will be plenty of time to ask questions in your first week of Phase 0.

Here is a rough timeline of what you should expect between now and your Phase 0 start date:

- Go through each task in this document. Each must be complete before your start date.
- You will receive an email one week before your start date to get you set up in the Phase 0 systems. You will not have access prior to this date.
- One of the systems you receive access to is Canvas, located at [https://devbootcamp.instructure.com](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com). The Week 0 module contains some activities that check whether you have done these prerequisites as well as a few new tasks, such as setting up your computer developer environment.** Plan on spending about 5-15 hours on the Week 0 material.
- During the first week of Phase 0 you will have an Introductory Session with your teacher to make sure you are set up for Phase 0 and to give you a chance to ask questions. These sessions are only offered during business hours, Monday through Friday.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback for the Phase 0 Team, please contact us at <phase0@devbootcamp.com>. Please mention your start date in the email.

** Please do set up your developer environment before starting Phase 0 unless you've already done so. It is far easier to set it up on a clean environment.

# Before Entering Phase 0

#### 0. Brief Introduction
Read our Blog Posts:
  - [Why Phase 0 is Key to our Student’s Success at Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/2014/05/08/why-phase-0-is-key-to-your-success-at-dev-bootcamp/) on Phase 0.
Phase 0 is a Phase of DBC; it is not optional. We cover the fundamentals you will need to be successful in the intensive on-site portion of DBC.

During Phase 0, you can expect to spend about 15-25 hours a week (on average) on the requirements and challenges in the curriculum. While there is some flexibility in when you decide do these challenges during the week, this is still a very intense experience that needs to be given time and dedication. It is not a time to go on a trip or vacation -- especially if you will be away from the Internet. The curriculum is separated into weeks and each week is due the Monday following its release. The program is not self-paced.

##### Work and Phase 0
Phase 0 is intense even though it is part-time. We encourage all students to continue working at least in a part-time capacity during Phase 0. This gives you additional financial stability -- it's expensive to take 10-16 weeks off for the on-site experience as well as time for job hunting. It also allows you to discover whether Dev Bootcamp is right for you with less pressure. If you find out web development isn't for you, it's important to have options.

You should be able to complete Phase 0 with a full-time job assuming your job does not require more than 40 hours per week. If it does, consider what you'll need to do to reduce those hours. The curriculum will require a lot of time and effort. If you've never programmed before, expect yourself to be at the high end of the 25- hour average (and maybe even higher). If you are working full-time, you will not have time to do many other things during Phase 0. This will get you prepared for the on site experience which will require 10-12 hour days (Mon-Sun).


#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need to create each of these accounts prior to your start date.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)<br> You will share your GitHub account with prospective employers, so keep that in mind when you create your username.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)<br> LinkedIn will be an important part of your career search once you graduate. If you have some of your information in there before you start Phase 0, it will be easier to cull during Career Week.

#### 2. Update your browser
We recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) in Phase 0. Please be sure you have the latest version of the browser.

#### 3. Typing and shortcuts
You have decided to enter a typing-heavy field, and you can never get too fast. Take some time to speed up your typing skills! Work on "touch typing" (i.e. typing without looking at the keyboard). You will be much faster as a programmer if you practice this early.

Take a baseline <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a> to see how fast you currently type.

Once you get practice with paragraphs, try working with code. <a href = "http://typing.lk/" target="_blank">typing.lk</a> allows you to time yourself and practice typing code and words.

Before entering Phase 0, you should be able to type at least 40 words per minute (minimum). If typing is something you struggle with, take some time to practice and improve. You can never get too good!

For more code examples, checkout <a href = "http://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a>.

You will be using Sublime Text during Phase 0 and on site, so you'll probably want to learn some shortcuts. Try <a href = "https://www.shortcutfoo.com/" target="_blank">shortcutfoo.com</a>. You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.

#### 4. Read the [Phase 0 Handbook](README.md)
This detailed document outlines the Phase 0 Program in great depth, so take time to read it to get comfortable with Phase 0 and Dev Bootcamp!

#### 5. Additional Resources (Optional)
Take a look at a couple of these resources that look interesting to you.

##### Books
- <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050" target="_blank">*Pragmatic Thinking and Learning*</a> by Andy Hunt. This book covers "how our brains are wired, and how to take advantage of your brain's architecture. You'll learn new tricks and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn."
- <a href = "http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do" target="_blank">*Apprenticeship Patterns*</a> by Dave Hoover. Are you doing all you can to further your career as a software developer? With today's rapidly changing and ever-expanding technologies, being successful requires more than technical expertise. To grow professionally, you also need soft skills and effective learning techniques. Honing those skills is what this book is all about. Authors Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye have cataloged dozens of behavior patterns to help you perfect essential aspects of your craft.
- <a href = "http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer" target="_blank">*The Passionate Programmer*</a> by Chad Fowler. This book is about creating a remarkable career in software development. In most cases, remarkable careers don’t come by chance. They require thought, intention, action, and a willingness to change course when you’ve made mistakes. Most of us have been stumbling around letting our careers take us where they may. It’s time to take control. This revised and updated second edition lays out a strategy for planning and creating a radically successful life in software development.
- <a href="http://www.barbaraoakley.com/books.html" target="_blank">*A Mind for Numbers*</a> by Barbara Oakley. In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!
- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Intelligent-Touchstone/dp/0671212095" target="_blank">*How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading*</a> With half a million copies in print, How to Read a Book is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader, completely rewritten and updated with new material. Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them—from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading. Readers will learn when and how to “judge a book by its cover,” and also how to X-ray it, read critically, and extract the author’s message from the text. Also included is instruction in the different techniques that work best for reading particular genres, such as practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science works. Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests you can use to measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension, and speed.
