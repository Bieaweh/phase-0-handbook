# Feedback

Please watch this [Engineering Empathy Video on Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) prior to giving feedback for the first time for some guidelines. 

Budget 5 minutes at the end of every pairing interaction to give each other Actionable Specific and Kind feedback (ASK). Trust that your pair can handle the ASK feedback that you give, even if it is negative. Giving and receiving effective feedback is a great skill to bring to your dev team and will ultimately allow you to learn faster.
