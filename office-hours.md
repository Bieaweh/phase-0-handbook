# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues to your teacher or a Phase 0 Guide. You can drop in at any time during the hour, but keep in mind questions will be answered in a first-come, first-served manner. Your teacher or guide will also leave at the end of the hour, so please try to attend as early as possible to get your questions answered.

You can bring many issues and questions to Office Hours including, environment or computer setup, general coding questions, and you can also bring your code to the session and ask for help on it (as long as it's not a solo challenge). Please refrain from bringing questions or projects that are outside of the scope of Phase 0 so other student's can get the attention they need with the curriculum.

There are two different types of office hours in Phase 0.

- Teacher-led Office Hours (Business hours)
  - These office hours are available through [Canvas](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com). Look at the calendar to see when they are scheduled. If you want to attend, go to the "conferences" under the course menu.
  - These sessions are exclusive to students in your cohort.
  - These sessions are offered during the business day (M-F) with a few exceptions depending on the teacher.

- Guide-led Office Hours (Outside of Business Hours)
  - View these office hours on the Phase 0 App in the [Office Hours](http://phase0.devbootcamp.com/office_hours) tab. You will be able to join the video call through the provided link when the event occurs.
  - These sessions are open to any student in Phase 0, so you will be in there with students in other cohorts
  - These sessions are offered after business hours and on weekends.

You will not be able to sign up for office hours, simply jump into the hangout or conference to ask your questions. You are not required to stay the whole time, and keep in mind, if there are multiple people in office hours getting help, your teacher or guide may help for a few minutes, give you a task to do, and then request you come back.

*If your guide misses the session, please email <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>.
