# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues to your teacher or a Phase 0 Guide. You can drop in at any time during the hour, but keep in mind questions will be answered in a first-come, first-served manner.

You can bring many issues and questions to Office Hours including, environment or computer setup, general coding questions, and you can also bring your code to the session and ask for help on it (as long as it's not a solo challenge). If your question is outside of the scope of Phase 0, please reserve your question until others have gotten help.

The office hours schedule is on the Phase 0 App [office hours](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com/office_hours) tab.

There are two different types of office hours in Phase 0.

- Advisor-led Office Hours (Business hours)
  - Advisors will add their times to the calendar first thing Monday morning.
  - The advisor leading the session will announce the start on your cohort's general Slack channel.
  - These sessions are exclusive to students in your cohort.
  - These sessions are offered during the business day (M-F).

- Guide-led Office Hours (Outside of Business Hours)
  - These sessions are open to any student in Phase 0, so you will be in there with students in other cohorts
  - These sessions are offered after business hours and on weekends.

*If your guide misses the session, please email <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>.
