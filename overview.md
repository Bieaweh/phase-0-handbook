# Welcome to Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0!

Now that you have successfully completed all your [Phase 0 Prerequisites](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/phase-0-prerequisites.md) you are ready to start the journey of Phase 0!

Phase 0 aims to familiarize you to the learning culture we foster at Dev Bootcamp. Dev Bootcamp is not a traditional school, every person who attends wants to change their life and become a web developer. We expect each student to take responsibility for their own learning, which includes exposing their ignorance, assessing their own progress, and reaching out when they have questions or need help. Dev Bootcamp is a learning community, and this community will provide support and guidance you need to accomplish your goal of becoming a web developer. The Phase 0 staff are only a small part of that community. Your peers will be the main support you have during the Phase 0 (and Dev Bootcamp) journey.

Being successful at Dev Bootcamp is not about discovering the right answer or writing the most perfect code. It is about your **own, honest, best** attempt at tackling the challenge. Sometimes, your attempts will not even produce a working solution, and that is OK. If your solution ends up being 30 lines of pseudocode and you don't know where to begin, make a comment saying where you are stuck and submit it. Then you can reach out for help (from other members of your cohort or a guide) in order to complete the challenge. The most important thing is your own assessment of whether you are learning and understanding the concepts presented.

**The Phase 0 program requires much more than coding by yourself. You'll learn more about the program by reading through the remainder of the handbook.**


### A Note on Voluntarily Repeating in Phase 0

If you are having a hard time working through the content, you may opt to repeat a unit (Unit 1: Weeks 1-3, Unit 2: Weeks 4-6, Unit 3: Weeks 7-9). Repeating gives you a second chance to complete the challenges you struggled with or did not complete.

Here are a few things to note if you are considering repeating a Unit of Phase 0:
* There is a $250 change fee because your spot in your original cohort will go unfilled.
* You will need to submit all work for the prior units again in your new course.
* You must re-do all GPS and Code Review challenges for the weeks you are repeating.
* You may only repeat each unit once.

If repeating is an option you want to explore more, please message your teacher in the Canvas inbox to discuss it.

If you are behind, your teacher may require you to repeat. If this is the case, the $250 fee will not be charged.
