# Welcome to Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0!

Now that you have successfully completed all your [Phase 0 Prerequisites](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/phase-0-prerequisites.md) you are ready to start the journey of Phase 0!

Phase 0 aims to familiarize you to the learning culture we foster at Dev Bootcamp. Dev Bootcamp is a program, not a school in the traditional sense. Every person who attends wants to change their life and become a developer. Each student is expected to take responsibility for their own learning. This means exposing your ignorance when you don't understand something, assessing your own progress, and reaching out when you have questions and need help.

Dev Bootcamp is a learning community, and this community will provide support and guidance you need to accomplish your goal of becoming a developer. The Phase 0 teachers and staff are only a small part of that community. Your peers will be crucial support during your Phase 0 (and Dev Bootcamp) journey.

Being successful at Dev Bootcamp is not about discovering the right answer (because there often aren't right answers) or writing the most perfect code. It is about your **own, honest, best** attempt at tackling the challenge. Sometimes, your attempts may not produce a working solution, and that is OK. Write that in your reflection and say where you got stuck. Be sure to reach out for help (from other members of your cohort, a guide in office hours, or your teacher) in order to complete the challenge. The most important thing is your own assessment of whether you are learning and understanding the concepts presented.

Although it may sometimes feel like it, Phase 0 is not an independent-study program. You will be required to pair and interact with others in your cohort on a regular basis. We recognize this will be more difficult for introverts, but it will be worth the reward of making meaningful connections with others. You'll learn more about the program by reading through the remainder of the handbook.
