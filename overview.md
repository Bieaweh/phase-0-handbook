# Welcome to Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0!

Now that you have sucessfully completed all your [Phase 0 Prerequisites](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/phase-0-prerequisites.md) you are ready to start the jouney of Phase 0!

Phase 0 aims to familiarize you to the learning culture we foster at Dev Bootcamp. Dev Bootcamp is not a traditional school. We expect each person to be here because they want to be here and they want to become a web developer. To that effect, we expect each person to take responsibility for their own learning, which includes exposing their ignorance, tracking their own progress, and reaching out when they have questions or need help. Dev Bootcamp is fundamentally about learning with a community, and this community will provide support and guidance you need to accomplish your goal. The Phase 0 staff are only a small part of that community. Your peers will be the main support you have during the Phase 0 (and Dev Bootcamp) journey. The Phase 0 staff is here to provide support; we just ask that you initiate the conversation.

Another important thing to note about this learning style is it's not necessarily about the right answer or the most perfect code. It is about your **own, honest, best** attempt at tackling the challenge. Sometimes, your attempts will not even produce a working solution, and that is OK. If your solution ends up being 30 lines of pseudocode and you don't know where to begin, make a comment saying where you are stuck and submit it. Then you can reach out for more help (from other members of your cohort or a guide) in order to complete the challenge. The most imporant thing is your own self assessment of if you are learning and understanding the concepts presented in the challenges. To aid in this self assessment we will give you feedback on your six Guided Pairing Sessions and four solo challenges. This feedback is intended to be just that, feedback. It is not to say if you are going to get kicked out of the program or not. It is to give you an idea of your progress, and more importantly your progress over time so you know where you have to put in more effort or if you need to ask for more help.

**During Phase 0 there will be things you are expected to complete. Here is a high level look at these expectations then you can go to that section of the Handbook to get more information.**

* Six [Guided Pairing Sessions](guided-pairing-sessions.md) divided between the three units

* Two [Peer-Pairing Sessions](peer-pairing-sessions.md) per week (this is not true for the first week)

* Giving and rating [feedback](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/feedback.md) for your cohort mates every week

* [Submitting](submitting-challenges.md) all the challenges and reflections as specified in the Curriculum at the end of the week

* Four [solo challenges](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/solo-challenges.md) that will be used for code reviews

* You will be expected to put in at least 15-25 hours of work per week (depending on previous experience) 

### Repeating in Phase 0

If you are having a hard time keeping up with the material or grasping the concepts, repeating a unit is a tool you can use to catch up. When you repeat, you will get a second chance with the challenges you did not feel comfortable with or ones you struggled to complete.

Here are a few things to note if you are considering repeating a Unit of Phase 0:
* There is a $250 change fee because your spot in your original cohort will go unfilled.
* All of the submissions you have already made for that unit will be deleted, meaning you will have submit all the work again.
* You must re-do all GPS and Code Reviews as well.
* You can only repeat each unit once.

If repeating is an option you want to explore more, please email <phase0@devbootcamp.com> to start the conversation and get the process started.
